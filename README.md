<h1>Greymail</h1>
<p>Greymail is a Terminal Based email client written in Rust using the <a href="https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs">tui-rs</a> library.</p><br>
<p>I've just really wanted something simple, something that I could open up and flick through in a few seconds.</p><br>
<p>It will support reading from multiple email accounts and writing new emails to people</p><br>
<p>As a stretch goal I would like to include some kind of Terminal HTML renderer for seeing more advanced emails in their correct format</p>
